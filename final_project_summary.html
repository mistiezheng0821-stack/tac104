    <h1>Project Summary</h1>
    <h2>Topic and Purpose</h2>
    <p>The topic of this website page is a travel blog.
        It's purpose is meant to document all my travel
        destinations and activities so I have a places
        where I can always refer back to for memories. 
        It acts as a travel journal for me.
    </p>
    <h2>Features I Implemented</h2>
    <p>The two features I implemented were <strong>iFrames</strong> and <strong>Media Tags</strong> Tags</p>
    <p><strong>iFrames:</strong> I implemented iFrames in my homepage (and Europe page)
        near the bottom of the page where it's titled "Latest Travel Page."
        I embedded my HTML page for the country I traveled latest to. 
    </p>
    <p><strong>Media Tags:</strong> I implemented media tags in my China and Japan page's 
        photo galleries. For China's page, I put a video of a chef cooking in the "Photo Gallery"
        section.For Japan's page, I put a video of a vending machine in the "Fun Freetime!"
        section.
