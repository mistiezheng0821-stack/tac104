                        a bus to the hotel, checked in, and unpacked.
                        We made a few nearby 7/11 runs, and later
                        I met up with my family for dinner.

                    <p> Today my dance team had a group outing. We wore matching

                        Senso-ji Temple, and Tokyo Tower in Shibakoen.
                        After the tour, I had dinner with my family and
                        stayed at their hotel.

                        Shibuya, then got dinner at the Tsukiji Fish Market.
                        At night, I went back to the hotel with my dance team.

                        10-2pm at a small studio. After rehearsal, I got Kura
                        Sushi with my friends, then we shopped around Takeshita
                        Street again. We ended off the night going to a pig cafe,
                        grabbed dinner, then went back home.

                        got a ticket to Tokyo's Disney, so we spent most of our day
                        there. My family also went as well, so I was with both my
                        friends and family. After Disney, we grabbed food and packed

        <div id="reflection-body">
            <p>
                This trip meant so much to me because it's truly a once in a lifetime experience.
                I can always go back to Japan, but I'll never have to chance to be here with
                my entire dance team while competing at the Olympics Stadium. Because of that, I think
                Japan is my favorite travel so far. What I loved most about my trip was just getting
                to spend time with my friends. It was the first time out the country without my parents,
                so getting that new experience of going out at night at 2am with my friends for a quick
                stop at 711 felt so independent and freing despite it being such a "small" moment.
                I always loved competing; the competitions in Japan are not the same in the US. They have a whole
                celebration before they announce awards, which is where I got to interact with many different
                teams despite not knowing each other and the language barrier. It truly felt like a community.
                What I think can be improved, is once again the weather. I don't think I've sweated more in my
                life. I also did not plan a lot of the places that I wanted to go, so I think I missed out on a lot
                of potential restaurants and activities I could've tried my time there. Overall, I
                think this is such a significant travel in my life and will always be one of my favorite
                moments.
