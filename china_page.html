                    <h3>Fujian</h3>
                    <p>
                        Fujian is my parents' hometown and where my grandparents
                        live, so we spent most of our time there. On the
                        first day we landed, we visited our grandma. She bought
                        us traditional Chinese food that we can't find anywhere
                        else. The next day, we got to our apartment, which is
                        where I spent most of my free time. In this province,
                        I did a lot of shopping since there was a shopping plaza
                        right across from our apartment. We also visited the night
                        markets often—they always had really good food at
                        extremely cheap prices, which I can't find in America. In
                        Fujian, I also visited "Shangfang Qixiang," otherwise
                        known as Three Lanes Seven Alleys. It was a street full
                        of stores, vendors, shops, and food. I also went hiking
                        to the mountains one day to see a temple that my dad had
                        donated to. The view was beautiful. One of my favorite things
                        about Fujian was the extremely cheap massages and head spas.
                        My mom would take me almost every other day to get my hair
                        washed by someone. Fujian is less developed, so I got to experience
                        local transportation by waving for rides on bikes, which felt
                        nostalgic. All my cousins from both sides of the family also
                        came, so we spent time together. Overall, I mainly spent my
                        time with family, tried traditional food and night markets,
                        and did some light shopping.

                    <h3>Shanghai</h3>
                    <p>
                        The next province we visited was Shanghai, one of the most popular cities in China.
                        This was a very different scenery from Fujian, as it is a lot more crowded
                        and city-like. I took the bullet train with my family to get here. It was
                        extremely hot, however I did most of my more fun activities here. One of the
                        days here, we dedicated to shopping at this busy street. The Gentle Monster
                        pop up collab with Jennie was hosted here, so I went inside to look
                        around and take pictures. Most of the Jennie collab sunglasses were sold out,
                        but I did end up buying a pair of glasses outside of the collab. After that,
                        I visited the Muji store as it is MUCH cheaper here than in America. Lastly,
                        I got to visit a cat cafe! It was really cute. We got to play with a bunch of cats
                        for an hour. Then, the next day, we also visited the more tourist-y attractions.
                        We visited The Bund; it was extremely beautiful at night but also extremely crowded.
                        I loved seeing the night lights and how all the buildings lit up. It was truly
                        beautiful in Shanghai. For my time here, I mainly spent my time shopping, taking
                        pictures, and visiting modern cities.

                    <h3>Zhejiang</h3>
                    <p>
                        The last province I went to was Zhejiang! I would say this province was a bit between
                        Fujian and Shanghai in terms of scenery. Zhejiang had a lot more of a naturalistic scenery
                        compared to the city-like Shanghai. I met up with another one of my relatives here since
                        he lived in Shanghai, and he lead us through all the attractions. It was amazing since he was
                        local, so he knew all the less popular hidden spots. It was refreshing compared to the very
                        busy Shanghai. The first thing we did was visit the Umbrella and Knives Museum. It was really
                        interesting
                        to see the the evolution of these everyday items. Next, we also visited a temple.
                        At this temple, I also got to be dressed in a traditional Chinese hanfu. I ended off this
                        province's trip
                        going to a live concert that showcased performaers singing, dancing, and playing musical
                        instruments
                        on water. For my time in Zhejiang, I mainly spent time looking at its beautiful scenery and
                        culture.

        <h2>Reflections & Thoughts</h2>
        <div id="reflection-body">
            <p>
                I had a lot of fun in China! What I loved most about being here is getting to revisit my
                childhood and seeing all the traditional food and spots that I had when I was younger.
                It was also really nice to visit family, and overall the trip meant most to be because
                of the sentimental experiences I had. I loved the night markets, I felt like I really got to
                indulge with my culture. I also loved experiencing all the other activities
                that I can't get through America; for example the live concert concert on water. What
                I didn't like on the trip and think can be improved is definitely the weather. It was insanely
                hot, which really made me not want to go out despite all the time I had here. I also think
                I should've planned a better itinerary for local places I want to try so I can get the most out of
                my trip. I had a great time overall.
